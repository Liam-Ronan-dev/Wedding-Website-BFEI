*Testing

- The first browser I tested the website's functionality on was Google chrome. Firstly I tested the mobile version which there were no problems or glitches encountered. Secondly I tested the desktop version, which there was a minor styling issue. The social icons were not coming into view in the footer area, therefore I had to adjust the CSS for the icons by increasing the margin-bottom. The issue was then resloved and tested again to confirm.

- The next browser I tested was Microsoft Edge. This browser worked flawlessly from mobile to desktop. I tested each page very carefully and had no issues

-The last browser i tested for functionality was Firefox. On the mobile version and desktop version, the google font I used for the Weddings page was not working. After some research, to reslove this particular issue I had to download the html code from google fonts while using the Firefox browser. This proved successful as the font was now showing.
